This application gives you everything you need to know about parking at Vanderbilt University: currently available parking lots, how to go there, parking policy, parking rates etc. It also includes user-centered functionalities such as automatically choosing best available parking lot according to preset user information and preferences, user making comments on a parking lot etc.

Currently this application only applies to Vanderbilt University campus. Potentially it can be expanded and developed to fit large scale areas such as a whole city.
