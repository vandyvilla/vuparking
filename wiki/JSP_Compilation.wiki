#How to compile JSP file in Eclipse.

= Introduction =

1. Download and install JDK. (JSPs require access to a compiler at runtime, whereas servlets don't have. (they're pre-compiled). The JRE doesn't have a compiler, it's just a
runtime environment.)
2. Go to Windows -> Preferences -> Java -> Installed JREs. 
3. Add a new JRE with type "Standard VM", make the home directory point to where JDK is installed. (on my laptop: C:\Program Files (x86)\Java\jdk1.6.0_18)
4. Click finish. Right now the red cross on jsp files disappears.
